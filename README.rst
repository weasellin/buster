Buster
======

Super simple, Totally awesome, Brute force **static site generator for**
`Ghost <http://ghost.org>`__.

Start with a clean, no commits Github repository.

*Generate Static Pages. Preview. Deploy to Github Pages.*

Warning! This project is a hack. It's not official. But it works for me.

The interface
-------------

``setup [--gh-repo=<repo-url>]``

      Creates a GIT repository inside ``static/`` directory.

``generate [--domain=<local-address>] [--target-domain=<target-address>]``

      Generates static pages from locally running Ghost instance to the target domain you prepare to publish.

``preview``

      Preview what's generated on ``localhost:9000``.

``deploy``

      Commits and deploys changes static files to Github repository.

``add-domain <domain-name>``

      Adds CNAME file with custom domain name as required by Github
Pages.

Buster assumes you have ``static/`` folder in your current directory (or
creates one during ``setup`` command). You can specify custom directory
path using ``[--dir=<path>]`` option to any of the above commands.

Don't forget to change your blog URL in config.js in Ghost.


The Installation
----------------

Installing Buster is easy with pip:

    $ pip install buster

You'll then have the wonderful ``buster`` command available.

You could also clone the source and use the ``buster.py`` file directly.

Requirements
------------

-  wget: Use ``brew install wget`` to install wget on your Mac.
   Available by default on most linux distributions.

-  git: Use ``brew install git`` to install git on your Mac.
   ``sudo apt-get install git`` on ubuntu/debian

The following python packages would be installed automatically when
installed via ``pip``:

-  `docopt <https://github.com/docopt/docopt>`__: Creates beautiful
   command line interfaces *easily*.
-  `GitPython <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython>`__:
   Python interface for GIT.

Ghost. What?
------------

`Ghost <http://ghost.org/features/>`__ is a beautifully designed,
completely customisable and completely `Open
Source <https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost>`__ **Blogging Platform**. If
you haven't tried it out yet, check it out. You'll love it.

software and trying to completely change the world of online publishing.
Consider `donating to Ghost <http://ghost.org/about/donate/>`__.
